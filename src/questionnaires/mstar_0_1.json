For example, the expat XML parser (written in C) has been found vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Even if you use a secure parser (or run it in a sandbox), things that can go wrong.<p>Various attacks rely on the attacker's ability to specify XML entities. Entities are \"codes\" (such as <code>&amp;quot;</code>) that are translated into defined strings by the parser. HTML has a predefined set of entities, but in XML, entities can be specified arbitrarily. An entity specification usually looks like this:<p><code>&lt;!ENTITY ent \"Hello!\"&gt;</code><p>With this definition, whenever the parser comes across <code>&amp;ent;</code>, it will replace it with <code>Hello!</code>. Entities are usually defined in the document type, which can be provided in a separate file or in the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> section at the beginning of an XML document.Entities are used in a variety of XML-related attacks. For example, they can be used for something called the <a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html'>billion laughs attack</a>, where an entity resolves to other entities, which resolve to other entities, etc., causing high memory usage and essentially resulting in a denial-of-service attack.<p>Even more serious is an attack using <a href='http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/6D0100A5PU.html'>external entities</a>. Definitions of external entities look similar to regular entity definitions, but they reference local files or URLs. Unless the XML parser has been specifically instructed not to expand external entities, a definition like <code>&lt;!ENTITY etc SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"&gt;</code> would include the /etc/passwd file where the entity &amp;etc; occurs in the XML document, leading to the disclosure of files as well as internal URLs.It is very important to restrict entity specification in user-provided or untrusted XML. Make sure your parser is adequately configured.",

For example, they can be used to confirm that requests fail without XSRF tokens; that authentication is required to access user data; or that unexpected HTML tags can't get through input filters or escaping routines.</li><ul><li><b>Release testing:</b> Before a new version of a product is released, human testers typically go through the application, try the new features, and make sure previous features still work correctly (regression testing). Security testing should be included in this process as well. For example, release testing is a great time to verify that user A cannot access the data of user B.</li><ul><li><b>Monitoring:</b> Once the application is deployed, the focus usually shifts from testing to monitoring. Watch out for unexpected spikes in error rates, sandbox violations, and other flaky or inexplicable behavior (including intermittent test failures) - and before you dismiss an anomaly, check with your security team. Crashes and flakiness can indicate a race condition or a memory corruption bug.</li></ul><p>The next few questions assess the testing and monitoring of your application.</p>"
